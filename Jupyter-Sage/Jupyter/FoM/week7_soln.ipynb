The code checks whether there exists a conic in $\\mathbb{P}^2_{\\mathbb{C}}$ containing these points. To do this, it considers the rank of the $7\\times 6$ matrix whose rows correspond to the evaluation of a general conic on each of the $7$ chosen points. If the rank is less than $6$, then there exists a conic containing all $7$ points; otherwise, such a conic does not exist. Running this code,  we see that the rank is always $6$. Thus, there is no conic in $\\mathbb{P}^2_{\\mathbb{C}}$ containing $7$ points among $P_1, \\dots P_9$.\n",
